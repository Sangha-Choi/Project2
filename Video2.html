        I threw a wish in the well
        Don't ask me, I'll never tell
        I looked to you as it fell
        and now you're in my way 
        I trade my soul for a wish,
        pennies and dimes for a kiss 
	I wasn't looking for this,
	but now you're in my way 
	Your stare was holding,
	Ripped jeans, skin was showing
	Hot night, wind was blowing
	Where you think you're going, baby? 

	  
        Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy,
	but here's my number, so call me maybe
        It's hard to look right, at you baby,
        but here's my number, so call me maybe
        Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy,
        but here's my number, so call me maybe
        And all the other boys, try to chase me,
        but here's my number, so call me maybe


        You took your time with the call
        I took no time with the fall 
        You gave me nothing at all
        but still you're in my way 
        I beg and borrow and steal
        Have foresight and it's real
        I didn't know I would feel it,
        but it's in my way 
        Your stare was holding, Ripped jeans,
        skin was showing, Hot night, wind was blowing,
        Where you think you're going, baby? 

        Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy,
        but here's my number, so call me maybe
        It's hard to look right, at you baby,
        but here's my number, so call me maybe
        Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy,
        but here's my number, so call me maybe
        And all the other boys, try to chase me,
        but here's my number, so call me maybe
        
        
        Before you came into my life I missed you so bad 
        I missed you so bad I missed you so, so bad 
        Before you came into my life I missed you so bad 
        And you should know that I missed you so, so bad 


        It's hard to look right, at you baby,
        but here's my number, so call me maybe (x) = but here's my number (o)
        Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy,
        but here's my number, so call me maybe 
        And all the other boys, try to chase me,
        but here's my number, so call me maybe

	
        Before you came into my life I missed you so bad
