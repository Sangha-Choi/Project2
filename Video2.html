	  <span class="p_first">I</span> threw a wish in the well
	  Don't ask me, I'll never tell
	  I looked to you as it fell
	  and now you're in my way
	  I trade my soul for a wish,
	  pennies and dimes for a kiss
	  I wasn't looking for this,
	  but now you're in my way
	  Your stare was holding,
	  Ripped jeans, skin was showing
	  Hot night, wind was blowing
	  Where you think you're going, baby?
	</p>
	  
	<p class="lylics">
      <span class="p_first">Hey,</span> I just met you, and this is crazy,
	  but here's my number, so call me maybe
      It's hard to look right, at you baby,
      but here's my number, so call me maybe
      Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy,
      but here's my number, so call me maybe
      And all the other boys, try to chase me,
      but here's my number, so call me maybe
	</p>

	<p class="lylics">
      <span class="p_first">You</span> took your time with the call
      I took no time with the fall
      You gave me nothing at all
      but still you're in my way
      I beg and borrow and steal
      Have foresight and it's real
      I didn't know I would feel it,
      but it's in my way
      Your stare was holding, Ripped jeans,
      skin was showing, Hot night, wind was blowing,
      Where you think you're going, baby?
